## Aim
To Write an assembly language program in 8051 to count the number of even and odd numbers in an array of 10 elements and display the counts.
---

## Apparatus Required
- Personal Computer  
- Keil ÂµVision software  
---

## Algorithm(ASCENDING ORDER)
1.Initialize:
----
Set R0 (data pointer) to 30H.

Set R1 (Even Count) and R2 (Odd Count) to 0.

Set R3 (Loop Counter) to 10.

Loop (10 Times):

Load the byte from the address in R0 into the Accumulator (A).

Use RRC A (Rotate Right through Carry) to move the byte's Least Significant Bit (LSB) into the Carry Flag (C).

2.Check Carry (C):
---

If C = 0 (Even number), increment R1.

If C = 1 (Odd number), increment R2.

Increment R0 to point to the next byte.

Decrement R3 and repeat the loop until R3 = 0.

3.Finish:
---
Store the final Even Count (R1) in memory location 50H.

Store the final Odd Count (R2) in memory location 51H.

Halt the program.
